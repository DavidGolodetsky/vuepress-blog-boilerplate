There is an opinion that a book has an advantage over a film in terms of immersing the reader in the different world, as his imagination is not limited to special effects. But here I would like to emphasize another aspect: when itâ€™s not about fictional worlds, but about the real experience of the hero, his feelings, reality surrounding him â€” literature copes with this better through author's digressions or character's monologues. In this regard, I would like to share with you several of my favorite authors who wrote their works on the basis of their own experience.

## Jon Krakauer. Into thin air

![Everest](https://m1.35photo.pro/photos_series/1169/1169134.jpg)

Being a writer, Krakauer worked as a journalist in Outside magazine. At that time, he was seriously interested in mountaineering and the magazine sponsored his participation in an expedition to Everest in 1996. The expedition turned out to be tragic, the details of the incident were documented by the writer indicating the exact time, like an investigator.  Harshly, accurately, succinctly in the style of Hemingway he describes the peaks blown by the wind, cracks in the glacier and heaps of used gas cylinders on the route.

> Now, for the first time on the expedition the vista was primarily sky rather than earth.

> â€” <cite>Jon Krakauer. Into thin air</cite>

In 2015 film [Everest](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2719848/) was released, where Krakauer was played by Michael Kelly. The film has amazing shots of the highest peaks of the planet, but there is no feeling of despair when a blizzard drowns out cries for help from those who lost track.


## George Orwell. Homage to Catalonia


Orwell not only invented a world of nightmare in the famous novel "1984", but also experienced something similar in 1936, when he went as a volunteer to Spain to fight fascism. It is this period, as the author claims, that has become decisive in his political worldview. This war is considered by historians as the first battle of two ideological worlds of the 20th century. It is worth mentioning that he was seriously injured in the neck and could never go down in history like a grinning lean British who talks about totalitarianism passing out recipes for making [tea with milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nice_Cup_of_Tea).  

The writer admires the democratic system of the republican army, their self-organization and devotion to ideals, but soon reality takes its toll. A dirty, brutal and ridiculous trench warfare, where recruits are taught to march instead of  shooting due to lack of ammunition. Military life is described in the smallest detail: lack of food and trenches stink of a latrine while spring begins.


> It seemed dreadful that the defenders of the Republic should be this mob of ragged children carrying worn-out rifles which they did not know how to use. I remember wondering what would happen if a Fascist aeroplane passed our wayâ€”whether the airman would even bother to dive down and give us a burst from his machine-gun. Surely even from the air he could see that we were not real soldiers?

![Spanish Civil War](https://media2.nekropole.info/2014/10/Dzordzs-Orvels.png)

The movie [# Land and Freedom](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114671) is most suitable for events described by Orwell. The main character is British, David. Like Orwell he goes to Spain to fight for his ideals,  not knowing that there will be disappointment and betrayal.


## Max Frisch. Montauk

Unlike the aforementioned works, Montauk is not full of exciting events. The author in an autobiographical form tells about different stages of his life. A story without an integral plot reminds one of life itself. Relations with friends and lovers, the joys of work and a well-deserved vacation, the beauty of everyday life and deep self-reflection, this is what you will find in the book. Generally speaking, these features are characteristic of many of Frischâ€™s works ([Homo Faber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Faber_%28novel%29), [Stiller](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiller_%28Max_Frisch%29), [Gantenbein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantenbein)). In each of this books you can trace author's nature in behaviour and thoughts of protagonist, who is facing with believable characters and problems.

> The writer is afraid of feelings that are not suited to publication; he takes refuge then in irony; all he perceives is considered from the point of view of whether it is worth describing, and he dislikes experiences that can never be expressed in words. A professional disease that drives many writers to drink.

If we talk about cinema, then the analogy with the [Paterson](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5247022) suggests itself. The film that can be called a joyful ode to everyday life.
