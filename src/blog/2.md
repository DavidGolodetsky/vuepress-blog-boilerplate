Meet Inis â€”  my favourite board game so far. The setting is about colonization of Ireland by ancient Celts. As a chieftain you need to conquest new lands, protect your clans and build sanctuaries to pray your gods. It's highly competitive, deep game with many options to win.

Me and my girlfriend both fond of it. We got it recently after the beginning of quarantine and it made the lockdown almost painless ðŸ˜„. Worth to notice that ,she is much better in it than I am, but I won't give it up so easily ðŸ˜¡. Here is our statistics from my app GeekScore which I should definitely write about later!

Gameplay reminds me Ciclades or GoT, but drafting technique make it more like a chess. It shines the most in duel games, since you know *almost* all your opponent 's cards, and you can make cautious decisions upon it. 

But in the game with 3-4 players (or 5 with Seasons extension), it gives you a lot of diplomatic opportunities. You need to make allies against the mutual enemy. But  you don't have to betray your associate in order to win in distinction from the above-mentioned games. t

There is room for bluffing and play at giveaway in order to win. And of course a nice portion of randomness, which make the game  Epic tale cards. Each card is a reference to a certain Celtic myth and they painted just wonderful!

Surely there is a lot more to be said about this game, but better for you to try it yourself. And don't forget to pick the right music for that.  [Our favourite music for the game ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVRqq947lNo)
