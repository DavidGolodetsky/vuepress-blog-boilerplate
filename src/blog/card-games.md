If during the quarantine you were lucky enough to be in the company of a loved one, then board games will come to the rescue from boredom and the constant shine of a monitor. Though, not everyone is so keen on them to re-read the rules of Inish (my favorite [board game](https://davidgo.netlify.app/blog/Inis.html)) for the 10th time to understand the difference between initiator and instigator 😁 . Also, the price of such "complex" games can push away some beginner board gamers. Perhaps the most budget games are card games. Therefore, I have selected for you several card games for two that are not difficult to learn, but still incredibly exciting to play!

## Vampire Empire

> In a foreboding castle somewhere in central Europe, a strange fear has descended upon the inhabitants. One morning the body of a young girl was found, as pale as a sheet of paper, dry and totally drained of blood. Vampires are on the prowl!

This short duel game combines bluffing with a stunning Gothic design. The game is asymmetric, each player has a unique deck of cards and abilities throughout the game. The first player plays for the vampires and takes the lives of the inhabitants of the castle one after another. The second plays for civilians who fight the dark in every possible way and try to figure out who among them is the embodiment of evil.

There are several ways to win in the game, which expands tactical possibilities, and there is a certain proportion of randomness in the deck of each player.
The game captivates with its atmosphere and gameplay. It is interesting to play both for one and the other side.

## Fox in the Forest

The setting of this game is built around [fairy tale](https://foxtrotgames.com/forest/the-fairy-tale/), written specifically for it (where else have you seen this? 😌). This cute, seemingly simple betting game has interesting mathematical mechanics. The game consists of several parties during which one of the players must score 21 points. The highlight of the game is that if a player wins too many bets, then the opponent gets more points. This gives you some room to "outfox" your opposer.

## Star Realms

Cosmic invaders at the doorstep! One of the brightest deck-building games, as well as one of the best duel games, will not leave you indifferent. The rules are simple, you need to destroy the opponent, but there are many tactics, especially if you play with add-ons. There are four fractions
of ships, each faction has its advantages and disadvantages. You cannot win by building your deck based only on one fraction (at least I can't 😅). In order to be efficient, you need to balance between them all and build connections. The game has a certain mathematical aspect, where you need to calculate average damage and predict the coming hand of cards.
We played this game most of all games, it is very addictive. Once they even tried the cooperative mode, but this turned out to be not our option.
Definitely recommend that for board game beginners, because it's cheap and really deep. One thing though, you better buy all existing extensions (which are also cheap) to give your games more variety.
