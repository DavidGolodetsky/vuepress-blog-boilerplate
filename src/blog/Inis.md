Meet Inis â€” my favorite board game so far. The setting is about the colonization of Ireland by the ancient Celts. As a chieftain, you need to conquer new lands, defend your clans, and build sanctuaries to pray to your gods. It's highly competitive, a deep game with many opportunities for victory.

Both my girlfriend and I fond of it. We got it recently after the beginning of quarantine and it made the lockdown almost painless ðŸ˜„. It's worth mentioning that she plays much better than me, but I won't give it up so easily ðŸ˜¡. Here are our statistics from my app [GeekScore](https://geekscore.netlify.com/) which I should definitely write about later!

The gameplay reminds me of Cyclades or GoT, but the drafting technique makes it more like chess. This most notable in duel games, since you know _almost_ all your opponent's cards, and you can make cautious decisions upon it.
On the other hand, the game gives you a lot of diplomatic opportunities, if you play it with 3-4 players (or 5 with Seasons extension). You need to create alliances against the mutual enemy, but you don't have to betray your associate to win in distinction from the above-mentioned games.

There is a place for bluffing and playing giveaways. And of course, there is a pleasant portion of randomness that makes the game â€” Epic tale cards. Each card is a reference to a certain Celtic myth and the artwork is just wonderful! [Jim FitzPatrick](https://www.jimfitzpatrick.com/) is one of the game's artists.

Surely there is a lot more to be said about this game, but better for you to try it yourself. And don't forget to pick the right music for that. [Our favorite music for the game ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVRqq947lNo)
